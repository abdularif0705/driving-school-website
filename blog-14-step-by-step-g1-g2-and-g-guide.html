                <p>Ontario uses a Graduated Licensing System (GLS) to take you from first-time learner to fully licensed
                    driver. At Rajput Driving School in Windsor, we help students move through every stage, from passing
                    the G1 knowledge test to mastering highway driving for the Full G road test.</p>
    
                <p><em>Rajput Driving School (Windsor) is MTO-approved and offers an <a href="blog-7-why-take-drivers-ed-in-windsor-ontario.html" class="text-primary"> MTO-approved BDE course</a>, G2/G preparation, and mock
                        tests. Need structured lessons or a car for exam day? <a href="registration.html"

                <p>Published on <time datetime="2024-07-23">July 23, 2024</time></p>

                <p>Getting a driver's licence is a liberating experience for many and a rite of passage for everyone.
                    Ontario's Graduated Licensing System makes the process straightforward while ensuring road safety.
                    New drivers in Ontario need to gain practical experience before driving independently with minimal
                    restrictions.</p>

                <p>The entire process takes at least 24 months to complete (two 12-month practice periods). However, new
                    drivers can reduce this timeline by 4 months by completing a <a

                <ul>
                    <li>Pass the G1 knowledge test at a DriveTest centre, which contains two multiple-choice sections –
                        Rules of the Road and Traffic Signs</li>
                    <li>Get driving experience with an instructor or fully licenced driver before taking the G2 road

                    <li>Be at least 16 years old</li>

                </table>
                <p><em>Note: When you first apply, you may need to pay for the G1 knowledge test, G2 road test, and
                        five-year license all at once ($159.75).</em></p>

                <h2>G1 Licence</h2>
                <p>In Ontario, the G1 license is equivalent to getting a learner's permit. This class is the first of
                    three to complete the Graduated Licensing System.</p>

                <p>To obtain a G1 licence, novice drivers must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be 16 years old</li>
                    <li>Pass a vision test</li>
                    <li>Pass the G1 knowledge test at a DriveTest centre (no appointments, walk-in only)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The G1 knowledge test</h3>
                <p>The G1 test includes 40 multiple-choice questions split equally between two sections – Rules of the
                    Road and Traffic Signs. You need to get at least an 80% (16/20) on each section to pass. This test
                    takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.</p>

                <p>The test is available in many languages, including English and French. If you aren't able to take the
                    written exam in one of these languages, you can schedule an appointment, bring an interpreter, and
                    take an oral exam at the office.</p>

                <p>Many DriveTest Centres also have audio versions of the test. If you have difficulty with reading or
                    writing, this may be a better option. You also have the choice of scheduling an appointment to take
                    the test verbally with an employee at the DriveTest Centre.</p>

                <h3>What should I bring to the G1 knowledge test?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two pieces of identification (e.g., passport, health card, birth certificate)</li>
                    <li>Money for test fees – cash, debit or credit card</li>
                    <li>Glasses or contact lenses (if you need to wear them to drive)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What happens if I fail the G1 knowledge test?</h3>
                <p>If you fail your first attempt, you can retake the test as many times as you need to. However, the
                    cost of retaking the test is $16.00 for each additional attempt.</p>

                <h3>How can I practice for the G1 knowledge test?</h3>
                <p>To practice for the G1 knowledge test, you can use one of three resources:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/driving-and-roads">MTO Driver's Handbook</a></li>
                    <li>Free <a href="https://www.g1.ca/g1-diagnostic-test/">online resources</a></li>
                    <li>A thorough <a href="https://www.g1course.com/courses/pass-the-ontario-g1-test/">prep course</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>G1 Licence – Rules and Restrictions</h2>
                <p>As a G1 licence holder, you'll face the most restrictions on the road as you learn to drive. This
                    includes the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can only drive if you are accompanied by a valid Full G licence holder. The accompanying
                        driver must have at least four years of driving experience, a blood-alcohol level of less than
                        0.05%, and be sitting in the front passenger seat when accompanying you</li>
                    <li>Each passenger in the vehicle must be wearing a seat belt</li>
                    <li>You are not permitted to drive between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m</li>
                    <li>You must not drive if you have been drinking alcohol or consuming cannabis</li>
                    <li>You are not permitted to drive on 400-series highways or expressways (e.g. Edgar Charles (EC)
                        Row Expressway, Gardiner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway (DVP), and the Queen Elizabeth Way
                        (QEW)) unless you're with a driving instructor</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How long do I need to wait before getting my G2 license?</h3>
                <p>G1 license holders must wait 12 months before taking their G2 road test (also known as the G1 exit
                    test). However, new drivers are highly encouraged to go through a <a
                        href="http://rajputdrivingschool.com/blog-7-why-take-drivers-ed-in-windsor-ontario.html">Beginner
                        Driver Education (BDE) course</a> at an MTO-approved driving school like Rajput Driving School,
                    which reduces the wait time to 8 months instead of 12.</p>

                <p>BDE courses are important for teaching new drivers about the rules of the road and how to navigate
                    complex situations they may encounter. Plus, most auto insurance companies offer discounts or
                    reduced premiums to new drivers that successfully complete the BDE course!</p>

                <h2>G2 Licence</h2>
                <p>As a G2 licenceholder, you'll be allowed to drive on your own for the first time!</p>

                <p>To obtain a G2 licence, new drivers must pass the G1 exit test. You could book a G2 road test via
                    phone, online, or at a local DriveTest Centre.</p>

                <h3>The G2 road test</h3>
                <p>This road test is approximately 20 minutes long and is designed to test your basic driving abilities
                    on city streets (does not include any 400-series highways). During the <a
                        href="http://rajputdrivingschool.com/blog-12-pass-g2-driving-test-on-first-try.html">G2 road
                        test</a>, the examiner will give you directions and assess your ability to complete
                    them. There are no set number of mistakes allowed on this test – it's up to the discretion of the
                    examiner to pass or fail the student based on the severity and volume of errors. Some of the
                    maneuvers that an examiner could test include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Parallel parking</li>
                    <li>Roadside stops</li>
                    <li>3-point turns</li>
                    <li>Left and right turns</li>
                    <li>Lane merging</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What should I bring to the G2 road test?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An accompanying driver with a valid G driving license and 4 years of driving experience</li>
                    <li>A vehicle in good driving condition</li>
                    <li>Money for test fees (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Glasses or contact lenses (if you need to wear them to drive)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What if I fail the G2 road test?</h3>
                <p>If you fail the G2 road test on your first attempt, you may retake the road test as many times as
                    needed as long as your G1 licence has not expired. The fee to retake the G2 road test is $53.75 for
                    each additional attempt.</p>

                <h2>G2 Licence – Rules & Restrictions</h2>
                <p>As a G2 license holder, you are given more freedom on the road due to your driving experience.
                    However, you are still under the following restrictions while you prepare for your Full G license:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each person in the vehicle must be wearing a seatbelt</li>
                    <li>You must not drive if you've been drinking alcohol or consuming cannabis</li>
                    <li>For the first six months, if you're 19 or younger, you're only permitted to carry one passenger
                        who is 19 or younger between 12 a.m and 5 a.m.</li>
                    <li>You can carry up to three passengers aged 19 or under between 12 a.m and 5 a.m. after six months
                        with your G2 licence and until you obtain your Full G licence or turn 20.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Note that the passenger restrictions no longer apply if you're accompanied by a Full G license
                        holder in the front passenger seat, or if your passengers are members of your immediate
                        family.</em></p>

                <h2>Insurance Requirements and Tips for G2 Drivers</h2>
                <p>As a G2 driver, you're now responsible for your own insurance. Unlike G1 drivers, who rely on their supervisor's coverage, you'll need to be added to a policy or get your own.</p>
                
                <h3>Using Someone Else's Car</h3>
                <div class="alert alert-warning border-0 shadow-sm">
                    <h6><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-2"></i>Critical Insurance Information</h6>
                    <p class="mb-2">If you're driving someone else's car, understand these important points:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-2">
                        <li><strong>Their Insurance Covers You:</strong> When you drive someone else's vehicle, their insurance is primary - meaning any accident or claim goes on their policy, not yours.</li>
                        <li><strong>Their Rates Will Increase:</strong> Any at-fault accident you cause will impact their insurance premiums, potentially for years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get Permission:</strong> Always ensure the owner has given you explicit permission to drive their vehicle and that you're listed as an occasional driver on their policy if you drive it regularly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> Even though it's their car, you're still responsible for any deductibles, tickets, or damages you cause.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-0"><small><strong>Best Practice:</strong> If you frequently borrow a vehicle, ask the owner to add you as a listed driver on their insurance policy to ensure proper coverage.</small></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Understanding G2 Insurance Costs</h3>
                <p>As a G2 driver, your insurance costs are usually higher because you're still considered a new driver with less experience. Insurance companies see young drivers as higher risk. However, rates often drop once you gain more experience and turn 25.</p>
                
                <p>Planning to buy your own car? Make sure to check insurance costs before you decide. Premiums depend on the car's type and features. Comparing quotes can help you find the best deal and avoid surprises.</p>

                <h3>Tips to Save on Insurance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Take a Driving Course:</strong> Completing a government-approved program can lower your premiums.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain Good Grades:</strong> Some insurance providers offer discounts to students with excellent academic performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shop Around:</strong> Comparing multiple quotes ensures you get the best coverage at an affordable price.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How long do I need to wait before getting my Full G license?</h3>
                <p>G2 licence holders will need to wait at least 12 months before taking their Full G road test (also
                    known as the G2 exit test). During this time, they're encouraged to practice driving as much as
                    possible and ideally in different weather conditions.</p>

                <p>They must also get experience driving on highways with speed limits of at least 80km/h. Not only will
                    they need to drive on a highway for the Full G road test, but they will also need to sign a
                    Declaration of Highway Driving Experience form before taking the test. This form will outline the
                    highway driving experience they've amassed over the 12+ months as a G2 license holder. In order to
                    take the G road test, G2 license holders must have driven on the highway at least 5 times within the
                    last 3 months.</p>

                <h2>Preparing for the G Licence Test</h2>
                <p>The G road test checks your ability to drive on highways and other more advanced skills. If you're not ready or lack enough highway experience, take more time to practice before booking your test.</p>

                        <p>After passing the G test, you can drive without restrictions, unless you're under 21. If you're under 21, your blood alcohol and cannabis levels must still be zero while driving.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Full G Licence</h2>
                <p>The G licence is the last stage of Ontario's Graduated Licensing System. With a Full G license, you
                    face even fewer restrictions as a driver in Ontario. You can obtain your Full G licence by passing
                    the G road test. Before you can take the G road test, you must have had your G2 license for at least
                    12 months.</p>

                <h3>The G road test</h3>
                <p>This road test is approximately 30-40 minutes long and is designed to test advanced driving abilities
                    on city streets and highways. Similar to the G2 road test, the examiner will give you directions and
                    assess your ability to complete them. Remember, it's up to the discretion of the examiner to pass or
                    fail the student based on the severity and volume of errors. Some maneuvers that an examiner could
                    test include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Driving on major streets and highways</li>
                    <li>Merging and getting on and off highway ramps</li>
                    <li>Turns, curves and lane changes</li>
                    <li>Navigating intersections</li>
                    <li>Any maneuvers done in the G2 road test</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What should I bring to the G road test?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A vehicle in good driving condition</li>
                    <li>Money for test fees (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Glasses or contact lenses (if you need to wear them to drive)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Full G licence – Rules & Restrictions</h3>
                <p>A Full G licence removes the majority of driving restrictions faced by G1 and G2 license holders.
                    However, Full license holders should be aware of the following restrictions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You can only drive G class vehicles in Ontario. G class vehicles include cars, minivans and
                        small trucks</li>
                    <li>If you are aged 21 years or younger, you must have a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of zero
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are over the age of 21, you cannot have a BAC of more than 0.08% (80mg)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What if you fail the Full G Road Test?</h3>
                <p>If you fail your Full G road test you can retake it as many times as needed, as long as your G2
                    license has not expired. You must wait 10 days between attempts and pay $91.25 for each additional
                    attempt.</p>

                <h2>Passing your licensing tests in the first try</h2>
                <p>Although pass rates for Ontario's G2 and G tests vary significantly based on the DriveTest centre,
                    your best bet is
                    to go through driving school and <a href="courses.html">learn with a certified instructor</a>.
                    Driving instructors are very familiar with the structure and topics covered in both the G2 and G
                    road tests. However, instructors alone won't get you the pass; remember, practice makes perfect – so
                    be sure to practice as much as you can before booking your tests!</p>

                <p>For your G1 knowledge test, doing a thorough, exam-like prep course is the best way to go.</p>
